06. I did the get first half of this question correct, but there was also another correct answer. This answer can also be considered correct because the user is still calling the paragraph function and changing the next all in one line. The only difference to the other correct answer was that it wasn't declared a variable first as it was not necessary.

05. This question talk about what are the rational operators in JavaScript. I did choose all of the rational operator, but also additionally choose the equal signs as one of the operations which it is not. A rational operation has the purpose of comparing two or more different values and the equal sign only sets the value.

06. Even though the repetitive if and else if statement did seem longer than the switch statement, which I've chosen, it is simpler in the way it is functioned. The if and else if statement is already programmed with a break function and since the condition for the switch and else if statements are the same, it would seem that the if and else if statement is more concise as the unnecessary break statement are removed compared to where it is necessary in the switch statement.

08. there are two correct answers in which the items in an array can be display. The correct answer is the old fashioned way as the other one is to console log in a for loop using Ex. let items of list, and then console.log(item). I was only mistaken by this because I though that the item was used as a counter to log the items in the array one by one, but actually they're the values in the array itself.

09. I do not know why this one is incorrect as there is clearly one number that has 4 4's. This number is considered to be greater than or equal to 100 but it is not less than or equal to 999 which break the condition and thus returning false to the tripleDigits array. If what was meant to be typed was "444" then the output would result in true as every number is within the range of 100 and 999. There is also some evidence in the same directory as this README file as evidence.
